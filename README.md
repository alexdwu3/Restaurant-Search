# Restaurant-Search
First app using React Native

Fetches data from Yelp API, displays restaurants, along with their star rating and reviews on the home screen

Currently working on improving styles, creating a page for individual restaurants, and creating an initial page, where user picks location to search for restaurants in (currently hard-coded as Milwaukee, WI)
